"""
Hello and welcome to my program designed to brute force password secured zips.
To make it work you will have to do 3 things.
- Change the file name at extract function;
- Switch between key_list or num_list at generator function.
- Define the passwords lengths you want to iterate through in the __main__ by modifying variable "x".
The software will automatically generate multiprocesses depending on the core count
and the password lengths you want to process through. The software always get into consideration the worst case
scenario if you try to input more "lengths" than the core count by cutting off the lower password length to iterate
through. 
- You might need to use "pip install pyzipper" - libary.
